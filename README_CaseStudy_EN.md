# 🕵️ Angler Exploit Kit - PCAP Network Forensics Case Study

This repository presents a network forensics case study based on the analysis of a `.pcap` file containing suspicious traffic linked to the **Angler Exploit Kit**. The captured data simulates a multi-stage exploit chain, including the download of malicious Java archive files and a PE32 executable payload.

The project includes a full forensic report (in PDF format) detailing:

- DNS queries and domain resolution associated with malicious infrastructure
- HTTP traffic patterns matching exploit delivery behavior
- Hash-based file validation and malware identification using VirusTotal
- Timeline reconstruction of the attack chain

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is not a real-world incident. The data, IPs, and domains analyzed are part of a controlled educational scenario. The project is developed solely for academic, training, and awareness purposes in digital forensics and cybersecurity.

## 📘 About the Report

The final report is written in Turkish and follows a structured format suitable for submission as an expert witness-style forensic document. It includes tables, threat analysis, and hash verification consistent with industry practices.

## 🎓 Intended Audience

- Cybersecurity students and enthusiasts
- Digital forensics learners and educators
- Incident response training programs
